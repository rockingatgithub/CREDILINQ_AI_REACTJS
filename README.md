## Getting Started

The project is to validate data provided for several fields based on company, application and documents.

# Tech stack

- NextJS
- Material UI
- NodeJS

# Steps to setup and run the project locally

- Clone the repository from [https://github.com/rockingatgithub/CREDILINQ_AI_REACTJS](https://github.com/rockingatgithub/CREDILINQ_AI_REACTJS)

- Then clone the backend repository from [https://github.com/rockingatgithub/CREDILINQ_AI_SERVER](https://github.com/rockingatgithub/CREDILINQ_AI_SERVER)

- Note:- The project can start without backend too. However, sending API calls wouldn't work without a backend.

- Run the below command:

```bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
#or
pnpm install

```

- Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/main](http://localhost:3000/main) with your browser to see the result.
